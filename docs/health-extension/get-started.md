## Get Started

### What is Dynatrace Health Tool Extension?

Dynatrace Health Tool Extension is an activeGate extension that is developed to pull and report key metrics. It leverages Dynatrace APIs to pull the metrics from the configured tenant. It will enable your customer to get a single pane of all the different health metrics in the tenant itself highlighting some of the usage and adoption features in Dynatrace.

### How does it work?
